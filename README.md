# Auto Emails
I use the script `autochores.py` to automatically update chores for my house each week.
\
The file: `encryption.py` contains logic to encrypt/decrypt my password, which is completely unnecessary but fun. It uses a Vignere type cipher which can encrypt strings of one or two byte utf-8 characters into discrete 64 character packages.
